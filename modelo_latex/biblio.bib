abstract = {Turbo equalization is an iterative equalization and decoding technique that can achieve equally impressive performance gains for communication systems that send digital data over channels that require equalization, i.e., those that suffer from intersymbol interference (ISI). In this article, we discuss the turbo equalization approach to coded data transmission over ISI channels, with emphasis on the basic ideas and some of the practical details. The original system introduced by Douillard et al. can be viewed as an extension of the turbo decoding algorithm by considering the effect of the ISI channel as another form of error protection, i.e., as a rate-1 convolutional code.},
